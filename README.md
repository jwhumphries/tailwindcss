# Tailwindcss
This is a personal build of tailwindcss v4 using the alpine `musl` release.

> [!NOTE]  
>  The standalone binary doesn't seem to be statically compiled, so I've provided `gcompat` as a compatibility layer. If you use this image to copy the binary, you'll need to account for this as well.
